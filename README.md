# SQL-Project
"Olist Store Analysis"

In this SQL project, I extracted and cleaned e-commerce transactional data by writing complex queries to join multiple tables and perform aggregations. The optimized datasets were then used for analysis, providing key insights into customer behavior, payment methods, and delivery performance, which informed business strategies for improvement.
